# Woodwork

Even I can admit that this is pretty ugly. The plan was to make something akin to a chest. However, in execution, it looks like a big box. Version 2 will be coming someday with a more sleek look.

## Planning

Being an amatuer, I like to draw everything first. I started in fusion 360 and sketched out the basic idea.
I wanted a hinged top to access the area wherein all the electronics would reside and thought it would be nice to have a bit of storage too...

## Implementation

Made from a couple of pieces of scrap baltic pine and some leftover fake leather from another project it came together looking something like the drawings. As I was cutting the uprights they looked really short so I decided to lengthen them. This was another mistake, I should've stuck to the plan. It is even more monolithic than the drawings.

| <b>Result</b> |

The lightstrip was another afterthought. This was a learning exersise and I had some WS2812b LEDs in the drawer with the rest of the components so they joined in the build.
