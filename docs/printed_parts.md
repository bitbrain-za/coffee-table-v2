# Printed Parts

## Mounting Hardware

For the mounting, a bunch of things were printed to hold everything in place.
Chances are you'll want to redo a lot of these for your own uses but they're included for reference.

A simple housing was done for the micro switches to make them mount into the front face of the table.

The idea was vuguely to make the push buttons look like studs on the table.
