## Overview

The project centers around things that bring me joy. Music, very amateur woodworking, learning new technologies and playing with LEDs.
This is going to be the start of a journey; I love the result, but not so much I can't see it's flaws so please keep an eye out for the polished version to come.

## Motivation

Do you remember the experience of browsing you CD colleciton and coming accross an old favourite you'd forgotten existed?
Or visiting someone and scanning the titles in their collection? That insight it gave you into their personality?

Streaming services give us so much but I missed the tactile experience of CDs. So this is my attempt to recreate some of that.

### Breakdown

This project touches a couple of fields and technologies. It is not intended for you to have experience with any of it to follow along, a lot of this was also me wanting to learn more about these things. Still, here's what we'll be covering.

- Embedded code (Node.js)
- MQTT communications
- Node red flows
- A bit of woodworking
- 3D printing
- Some minor hardware
